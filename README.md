I’ve developed a web-based Nmap Command Executor that allows users to easily perform network scans directly from a streamlined interface. 📡🔍

You can now access Nmap easily through our new web tool! No need to dive into the terminal—enjoy a user-friendly interface and stunning visuals for all your network scanning needs. 🖥✨

Key Features:

🖥️ Supports various Nmap scan types (e.g., Ping Scan, SYN Scan, OS Detection) 

💾 Option to save scan results in text files for later review
🛠️ Simple and user-friendly interface with real-time output
🔐 Secure execution with sudo-enabled Nmap commands 

The project includes full source code and detailed documentation to help you set it up and run it effortlesly. Perfect for system admins, network engineers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts! 💻✨
